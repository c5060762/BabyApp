# BabyApp Smart Audio Recorder

The BabyApp is a smart Audio Recorder that is triggered when ambient noise exceeds a preset threshold and uploads the consequent audio files to a webserver. 

# Specification

The app starts an Android background Service which measures the current sound level as registered by the microphone of an Android Smartphone. It will start an audio recording if the sound level exceeds a preset value.
